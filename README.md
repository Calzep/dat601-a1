# dat601-a1
Repository for my first assessment for DAT601 Database Concepts.

This repository contains a written report and an SQL script.

The written reports contains an introduciton to data modelling in information systems, an overview of conceptual modelling, and a conceptual model, data dictionary, and assumptions of business rules for the FlightStream database scenario.

The SQL script contains the creation scripts and data insertion scripts for an example database (unrelated to the FLightStream scenario) and a selection of queries to demonstrate my knowledge of T-SQL.

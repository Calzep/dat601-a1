# dat601-a1
Repository for my second assessment for DAT601 Database Concepts.

This repository contains a written report and an 2 SQL scripts.

The written reports contains conceptual modelling, logical modelling, and physical implementation of a database.

The first SQL script, BusinessDatabase contains the creation scripts and data insertion scripts for an example database (unrelated to the FLightStream scenario) and a selection of queries to demonstrate my knowledge of T-SQL.

The second SQL script, FlightStreamDBScript, contains the creation scripts, data inserting scripts, and queries for the Flight Stream database.
